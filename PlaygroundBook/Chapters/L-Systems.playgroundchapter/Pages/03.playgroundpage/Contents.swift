/*:
 So far we've always turned by an angle of 90 degrees. We'll change that now by defining a new variable which sets our angle. As we'll use radians as a unit, here's a quick refresher on how radians relates to degrees.
 
 1. Set the axiom to `FRRFRRF`
 2. Create a rule which replaces `F` with `FLFRRFLF`
 3. Set the angle to 60Â° in radians
 4. Run your code to see a beautiful Koch snowflake emerge!
