#  L-systems #
This is my WWDC19 Scholarship submission. It gives an introduction about L-systems, an easy way to generate awesome looking fractals. 

If you want to try it out on your own iPad just clone this repository and AirDrop the L-systems.playgroundbook file over.

You can also find a YouTube-Demo [here](https://youtu.be/4YhSK8Fg_pE).
